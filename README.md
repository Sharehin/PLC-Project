# Industrial Automation

## Box Sorting Algorithm:
Programmed a PLC to automate a simulated conveyor-based sorting system using sensor inputs and actuator controls, demonstrating logic for process sequencing and decision-making.

## Motor Control with Integrated Safety: 
Developed a control program for an up/down motor system featuring emergency stop, limit switches, and safety interlocks, emphasizing fail-safe operation and hazard prevention.

## Traffic Light Simulation: 
Created and debugged timing logic for single and multi-way traffic light intersections, solidifying skills in sequential control and timer/counter programming.
